KNOWN BUGS:

The HUD occasionally doesn't update until after your next move if you've been buying from the shop.

STYLE INCONSISTENCIES:

There may be a few instances of the following discrepancy:

if (...) {
  ...
}
else { ... }

vs

if (...) {
  ...
} else {
  ...
}

as well as general minor things such as inconsistencies with the placement of parenthesis. We apologize for any lack of clarity induced.
